# Code_Brunner_Downscaling-future-land-cover-scenarios
## Some Code used for the analysis in "Downscaling future land cover scenarios for freshwater fish distribution models under climate change"

**Code_Landcover_expl.md**: Code for cropping, reclassification, resampling of the land-cover maps with gdal, grass Gis and pk-tools as well as area calculation of the single land-cover classes 

**Data_prep_SDM.R & Data_prep_SDM_full.R**: Preparation of environmental data for the SDM (full= wider range of variables with correlation check) 

**Graphs_env_species.R**:  Code for creating the graphs showing the mean environmental conditions of species habitats

**LUCC_SSP1_10_final.egoml**: Dinamica EGO Code for the final Land-cover modelling (exemplary for SSP1)

**SDM_ensemble.R**: Code of the Species Distribution model ensemble

**analysis_species_final.R & analysis_endemic_final.R**: Code for Analysis of the SDM outcome, including influence of environmental variables

**fish_1980-2018.R** : Preparation of the species data
